 Introduction:
 This Bezier Curve Generator uses the proper algorithm to generate n-th order 
 bezier curve,n could be up to 20. To use it, just click and drag inside the 
 canvas, the green control points will be generated and the curve will be 
 changed accodringly. The right column shows the basic data for the current 
 curve. You can also copy the points in the textarea and paste them when you 
 reload or leave the page, just simply click Apply Your Control Points button
 and all the points will be restored.
 When you choose or drag a control point, it will turn into purple, the start 
 point is brown and the end point is orange. 
 Use numerical approximation method (Gauss Quarature)to calculate the arclength of 
 n-th bezier curve, which is extremely efficient.
